## Ant design and demo case introduction  

Ant Design React is dedicated to providing a good development experience for programmers. Before starting, it is recommended to learn React and ES2015 first, and correctly install and configure Node.js v8 or above (https://ant.design/docs/react/getting-started). Most of the time, people judge a thing by its physical appearance and the web application is no exception. A website can leverage the UI/UX experts to achieve the goal, or we can just apply some pre-defined UI/UX framework such as Ant design to meet the same desire.   

The demonstration will focus on the part of Customer Relationship Management or CRM system: `membership creation` and `management`. The scenario is that a non-profitable organisation want to keep the connection of their membership to promote events and training. The organisation does without much budget to maintain an IT expert team or outsource the web development. The only resource is the summer intern. The requirement from the client is to generate a simple CRM to manage their membership but not compromise with the look. Thus, applying a well-development UI framework such as Ant design is the best way to deliver an app with well and consistent looking in a limited time. Following is the prototyping of the website.
